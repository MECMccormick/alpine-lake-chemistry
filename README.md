# Alpine Lake Chemistry in the US Forest Service Ecoregion 2
This repository contains data and code for exploring the link between alpine lake chemistry and bedrock geology, and for analyzing changes in lake chemistry over time.

## Data
The lake chemistry data are not yet published, but will be via the USFS following federal guidelines. I have made the version I'm working with available in this repo. Please contact me if you have any issues accessing it in order to run the python scripts.
