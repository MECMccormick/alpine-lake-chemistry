# Alpine Lake Chemistry: A long-term study of water quality in the alpine lakes of the US Forest Service Ecoregion 2
This repository contains data and code for exploring the link between alpine lake chemistry and bedrock geology, and for analyzing changes in lake chemistry over time.

## Data and Packages
The lake chemistry data are not yet published, but will be in the future via the USFS following federal guidelines. I have made the version I'm working with available in this repo. Please contact me if you have any issues accessing it in order to run the python scripts.

Currently, the entire workflow is contained in the 'ea-2021-lakechem-proj-MECM.ipynb' file. As long as you have downloaded the data provided in this repository, the notebook should run from start to finish with no issues.

You will need the following packages in order to run this notebook:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* earthpy
* geopandas
* folium
* contextily
* seaborn
